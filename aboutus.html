            <h1>More About Us</h1>
            <p> Thank you for visiting our website and taking a look around! We offer discounted designer bags and wallets, primarily Tory Burch, that can only be found at outlet stores. An outlet store is different from other retail stores as it offers older merchandise (as in from the previous fashion season) or merchandise that is specifically made for the outlet. Outlet items are only sold in store and cannot be purchased online. With our staff purchasing the items for you, you don't have to make the journey yourself to an outlet, which is extremely beneficial as there are only a few outlet centers in the whole country!</p>
